# Loan-Approval-Prediction

**Overview**:
This project aims to build a predictive model for loan approval decisions using machine learning techniques. By analyzing applicant data, the model can predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected. This can help financial institutions streamline their loan approval processes and minimize the risk of defaults.

**Tech Stack Used**:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn


****Project Overview**:
**This project involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the data through visualization and statistical analysis.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features and transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
Model Development: Building and training machine learning models to predict loan approval status.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the models using various metrics.
Results: Analyzing the outcomes and selecting the best model.

**Models**:
The project includes several machine learning models for loan approval prediction:

Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest


**Model Evaluation**:
We evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score.

**Results**:
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 77% on the test dataset
