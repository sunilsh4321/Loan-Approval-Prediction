# Loan-Approval-Prediction

**Overview**
This project aims to build a predictive model for loan approval decisions using machine learning techniques. By analyzing applicant data, the model can predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected. This can help financial institutions streamline their loan approval processes and minimize the risk of defaults.


**Features**
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Feature engineering
Model training and validation
Hyperparameter tuning
Model evaluation


**Models**
The project includes several machine learning models for loan approval prediction:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest

**Evaluation**
The models are evaluated using metrics such as:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
